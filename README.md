Timer basically came with some pre-done CSS and HTML.
I mainly messed with the CSS and wrote the JS following the tutorial~ 
It is a bit icky on mobile and I am slacking on fixing that. <3


Files for my timer are located in the [draft](https://github.com/Hiratsuna/pomodoro-js-node-ghpages/tree/draft) branch
